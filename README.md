# Cranberry - Full-stack ecommerce App

This one is my biggest personal project so far. Users can filter products based on category, brand, price range, select a size and add that product to checkout. User need to first create an account then verify their email, in order to proceed to checkout. After successfully signing up, users need to provide some personal and shipping information, which they can do either in their personal account page or while checking out. After that they can finalize their order.
